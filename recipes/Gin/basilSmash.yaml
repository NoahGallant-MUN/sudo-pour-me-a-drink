name: Basil Smash
ingredients:
  - 2 ounces gin
  - \threequarter\ ounce fresh lemon juice
  - \threequarter\ ounce simple syrup
  - 4--6 leaves of fresh basil
instructions: Add two ounces of gin to a cocktail shaker, followed by three quarters of an ounce of both fresh lemon juice and simple syrup, and finally four to six leaves (torn in half) of fresh basil. When you shake the cocktail, the ice will bruise the basil, imparting its herbal notes on the drink. Fill the cocktail shaker with ice, shake vigorously, and strain over ice into an old fashioned glass. Garnish with a sprig of basil.
